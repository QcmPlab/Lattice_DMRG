# Lattice DMRG

*This library is under rapid development. Be cautious.  
Name and repo will also be changed in a future release.*

This is a simple enough DMRG code to solve Electrons problems on a lattice (1d so far) as a milestone in the construction of a Quantum Impurity solver for application to Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. 

This code should also include Quantum Number conservation at some point. 

The structure of this code is largely based on the simple Spin_DMRG and extend it to the case of interacting electrons. It is possible in the future the two codes will merge.  

### Dependencies

The code is based on:  

* SciFortran [https://github.com/aamaricci/SciFortran](https://github.com/aamaricci/SciFortran)  

* MPI [ma non Ã¨ una cosa seria]

  
### Installation

Installation is not fully supported so far. In a future release a CMake installation will be made available.    

For the time being Clone the repo and DIY
