# Electrons DMRG

*This library is under rapid development. Be cautious.  
Name and repo will also be changed in a future release.*

This is a simple enough DMRG code to solve Electrons problems on a lattice (1d so far) as a milestone in the construction of a Quantum Impurity solver for application to Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. 

This code features Quantum Number conservation. 

This code is largely based on the more simple Spin_DMRG and extend it to the case of interacting electrons.  

### Dependencies

The code is based on:  

* SciFortran [https://github.com/aamaricci/SciFortran](https://github.com/aamaricci/SciFortran)  

* MPI 

  
### Installation

Installation is not fully supported so far. In a future release a CMake installation will be made available.
